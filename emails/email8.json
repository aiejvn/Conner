Overall, we're seeing great improvement!\n\nPositive trends:\n- Lead quality score increased by 22%\n- Conversion rate from MQL to SQL up 18%\n- Average deal size 12% higher than Q2\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- Tech industry leads need better qualification\n- Geographic targeting could be refined for West Coast\n\nCould we schedule a 30-minute meeting next week to discuss optimizing the lead scoring criteria? I think we can push conversion rates even higher.\n\nThanks for the great collaboration!\n\nCarlos\nSenior Sales Manager",
